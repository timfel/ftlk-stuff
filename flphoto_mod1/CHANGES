	  with the ability to specify the size of the slideshow
	  window.
	- Added support for showing the first frame of AVI files
	  (Motion-JPEG AVI files only)

	  image files to keep the number of files per directory
	  down.

	  download directories for each camera model.
	- The camera import dialog now automatically rotates
	  images based on the EXIF orientation value.

v1.2

	- When printing from CUPS, flPhoto passed all of the
	  saved options even if they conflicted with the print
	  dialog options.
	- flPhoto crashed when printing images in portrait
	  format.


v1.2rc2

	- The credits page in bound calendars was upside-down.
	- Updated the print dialog to support a separate "print
	  to file" checkbox so that you can print output that is
	  formatted for a specific printer to a file as well.
	- Changed the default side margins to 0.25" and the
	  top/bottom margins to 0.5".
	- The "normal" output quality did not use an appropriate
	  image resolution.


v1.2rc1

	- No longer scan the .xvpics directory when reading
	  images from a flash card.
	- Added new bound and folded calendar printing.
	- The current album was not added to the previously open
	  album list when saved.
	- CTRL-X was bound to both Export and Crop Image. 
	  SHIFT-CTRL-X is now used for Export and CTRL-X for
	  Crop Image.
	- Fixed font encoding when printing accented characters.
	- Fixed handling of non-JPEG images; previously, the EXIF
	  support code would try to load EXIF data from a
	  non-JPEG image, and the JPEG library would exit.
	- Added a new --camera command-line option to display
	  the camera import dialog.
	- The crop dialog now displays the current crop
	  dimensions.
	- The crop dialog now provides some standard aspect
	  ratios as well as the current image aspect,
	  user-defined custom ratios, and no ratio.
	- flPhoto would crash if you purged the last image in an
	  album.
	- The camera import dialog now supports downloading
	  images from flash cards and other USB storage devices.
	- The camera import dialog now purges its cached
	  thumbnails when the dialog is closed or when the
	  camera is changed. This prevents the wrong thumbnail
	  images from showing up.

	  removing red-eye.  Red-eye removal is now performed by
	  clicking on the specific areas that need to be
	  changed.
	- Added separate options dialog for slideshow and image
	  options.
	- Added album history.
	- Added support for an external image editor.
	- The HTML export dialog now supports stylesheets.

	- More updates to the French translation.
	- More fixes for Cygwin.
	- Cancelling a download of images left an empty image
	  file.

	  files.

	  with multiple image files on the command-line.
	- flPhoto didn't recognize both .JPG and .jpg filename
	  extensions for JPEG files in all cases.
	- The gamma lookup table was not generated properly,
	  resulting in output that was too dark.
	- Updated the French and German localizations and added
	  Italian, Portugese, and Spanish.
	- The exported HTML did not offer a translation of the
	  "Back to Thumbnails" string.
	- The camera import dialog didn't check for an existing
	  directory and make it if necessary.

	  the current album.

v1.1rc2

	- The batch image "purge" operation deleted the current
	  image and not the selected images (which were just
	  removed from the album...)
	- The batch image operation menu is now labeled
	  "Selected Images" instead of just "Images" to avoid
	  confusion.
	- All batch image operations ask the user for
	  confirmation before continuing.
	- Non-image files are downloaded from digital cameras
	  but are no longer added to the album (with a warning
	  message to the user...)
	- JPEG images can now be re-saved in progressive or
	  non-progressive mode without loss of quality.
	- Makefile fixes (install and message catalogs) plus a
	  new RPM spec file.

	- The slideshow link wasn't shown if all of the

	  directory.

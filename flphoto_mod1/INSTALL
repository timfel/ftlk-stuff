REQUIREMENTS

flPhoto is written in C++ and requires version 1.1.8 or higher of
the FLTK <http://www.fltk.org> toolkit.  In addition, the
following libraries, if available, allow flPhoto to support
additional capabilities:

	- CUPS <http://www.cups.org>
	- gPhoto <http://www.gphoto.org>
	- JPEG <http://www.ijg.org>
	- PNG <http://www.libpng.org>
	- ZLIB <http://www.zlib.org>

In order to compile flPhoto, you'll need an ANSI C++ compliant
compiler (GCC works fine, as do most vendor C++ compilers).
Currently flPhoto is only being developed under UNIX/Linux,
however since flPhoto is based on FLTK it should also compile
under MacOS X and Windows.


CONFIGURING

flPhoto includes a typical GNU autoconf-based configure script.
Just run:

	./configure

to configure the source for your system.


COMPILING

Run the make program to compile the software on your system:

	make

If you are building on FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD, you'll
probably need to use the "gmake" program instead.


INSTALLING

Run the make program with the "install" target to install the
software on your system:

	make install

If you are building on FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD, you'll
probably need to use the "gmake" program instead.


REPORTING PROBLEMS

Please report all problems to "flphoto@easysw.com" or to the
FLTK mailing lists or newsgroups at:

I'm typically swamped with email, so I ask for your patience in
advance.

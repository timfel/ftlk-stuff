CAUTION:

An incompatible binary API change has been introduced in this version
of fltk118-utf8.

This version, fltk118-utf8-2007-07-14, has a major change "under the hood"
in that fonts indices are no longer stored in an unsigned char, as they
were in previous versions of fltk-1.x.

The use of a uchar index limited the number of fonts that could be easily
referenced to just 256 - a limit that many modern systems easily exceed,
having many more fonts installed.

In this version, a new type "fntidx" has been used to define all the 
font indices.
In this version, fntidx it is an int, but as the implementation
develops it may be replaced by a different underlying type.

NOTE: This "fntidx" type is TEMPORARY - it will not remain in the code.
It is in as a "marker" to allow me to quickly and easily find all the 
relevant code sections, and to switch the type about for experiments.

DO NOT assume that the "fntidx" is available for use, - as it may not be tomorrow...
